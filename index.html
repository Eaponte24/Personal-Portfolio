            <p>I'm Ricky Aponte, I'm a 28 year old photographer from Connecticut and looking to change career paths into coding. I'm currently enrolled in Uconn's online coding bootcamp looking to make that dream come true. I've been a photographer for the past 12 years and enjoy skateboarding in my free time along with being a big movie buff. As well as I love to shoot films whenever I can, as you can see in the image above that's one of my personal images.
 
              I’ve made this portfolio to showcase some of my works from my time in the boot camp. I hope whoever sees this enjoys this page I’ve made enjoys not only the work I've put into it but also the works that are linked within. If you have any questions pertaining to any of the works here feel free to contact me at the links below.</p>
